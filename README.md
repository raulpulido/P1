## Game planning

+ _Create an array of three options, Rock, Paper and Scissors._
+ _Create the variables playerA and Player B and Randomly assing a value between 0 and 2_
+ _because we are going to use the id of the array game to define what option was selected_
+ _I decide to use the Module AritmeticTaking the selection of Playe A minus selection of Playber B and apply  the Operator Module "%" with the number 3 we can obtained the following _module number:_
+ _0,1,2,-1,-2_
+ _where  0 = Tie,  1 and -2  player A wins, 2 and -1 Player B wins._
+ _Assign Player B's move to whatever option was not chosen._
+ _Randomly choose from the array of heads/tails again and assign this as the "flip" value_
+ _I decide to follow the approch of use Operator Module for my game. In this way we simplify and reduce the if conditions to 3.
+  Taking the selection of Playe A minus selection of Playber B and apply  the Operator Module "%" with the number 3 we can obtained the following module number:
// 0,1,2,-1,-2
// where  0 = Tie,  1 and -2  player A wins, 2 and -1 Player B wins.
