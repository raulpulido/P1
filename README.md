# Project 1

## Game planning

+ _Create an array of three options, Rock, Paper and Scissors._
+ _Create the variables playerA and Player B and Randomly assing a value between 0 and 2_
+ _because we are going to use the id of the array game to define what option was selected_
+ _I decided to follow the approach of using the Operator Module to validate who wins. In this way, we simplify and reduce the "if" conditions to 3._
+ _The formula is:_
   
   _the selection of Playe A minus selection of Playber B and apply  the Operator Module "%" with the number 3._
    
  _($playerA - $playerB) % 3_
  
  _we can obtained the following _module number:_
  
  _0,1,2,-1,-2_
  
  _where  0 = Tie,  1 and -2  player A wins, 2 and -1 Player B wins._
+ _I create a function that receives the variable $gameModCalculation and evaluate who wins._
+ _Additional, we have en el folder 'images'  rock.jpeg, paper.jpeg, and scissors.jpeg and we display base on the randon number assign to each player_
